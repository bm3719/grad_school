This includes some of the code I'd written from 2002-2004 while
attending the master's program for computer science at Shippensburg
University in Pennsylvania.  Whatever I don't have here was somehow
lost.

Most of this is pretty embarrassing by my current standards, but
there's a few things in here I'm still reasonably proud of.
